           Using fuzzy inference it is possible to obtain a fuzzy classification based on a fuzzy index:

        <img src="Screenshot%20(60).png">
        </center>
        <br>
           The values of the index can vary depending on the membership function
            attributed to the fuzzy values. This example illustrates that the use of fuzzy values
            and operations allow the manipulation and ordering of data with multiple
            criteria.

        Traditionally, most organizations make a decision based on successful past
            experiences, that is, they are refining an already known procedure. Decision
            alternatives are formulated and selected by quantitative methods of Operations
            Research, and qualitative methods employing techniques of Artificial Intelli-gence, formulated by expert systems and fuzzy inference. This attitude corre-sponds to a search for organization intelligence using a refinement procedure.
            Refinement means improving, regulating, producing, and recording existing
            knowledge. It involves choice, efficiency, and reliability. It normally leads to an
            improvement, but it can be blind to the search for new solutions.
        <br><br>
            The definitions of a DSS, according to different authors (Turban & Aronson,
            1998; Cook & Russel, 1993, Li & Ye, 1990; Mallach, 2000) are:
        <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A DDS is a set of procedures (software programs) based on a data-processing environment to analyze problems with the aim to assist
                managers in making decisions. The problems resolved by a DSS
                can be of a structured, semi-structured, or nonstructured type,
                according to the point of view of the people making decisions. A
                &nbsp; DSS is a flexible and expansive system, capable of giving support
                and providing ad hoc analysis of data and decision models, in the
                search to obtain efficient results in long, mid and short-term
                planning.
        <br><br>
               A DSS is a computer system made up of three interactive components:
        <br><br>
               a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  a system of language (that allows communication among users and
                the DSS sub systems;<br><br>
               b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; a system of knowledge (that stores available data, procedures and
                intelligent information);<br><br>
               c.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  a system for processing problems (structuring and executing appro-priate models to solve problems); and<br><br>
               d.&nbsp;&nbsp; a system that allows the sensibility analysis of the result of decision,
                providing a response to the “what-if?” question, such as question of
                the type “what would happen to this result if the  data utilized were
                30% greater?”<br>

        <h3>Reasons for Using a DSS</h3>
        <div style="width: 100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
        <br>
        According to Turban and Aronson (1998), in an article published in <i>Computer
            World (September, 27, 1982), the Firestone Tire & Rubber Co</i> listed the
            following reasons for using a DSS:
        <br><br><br>
           •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the company was facing growing competition in the country and abroad;<br>
           •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the company was having increasingly greater difficulty in monitoring its
            numerous business operations;<br>
           •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Information Systems department was not managing to meet the
            company’s diversity of needs or to answer ad hoc questions raised by the
            managers.

        <p>According to Turban and Aronson (1998), in an article published inComputer
            World (September, 27, 1982), the Firestone Tire & Rubber Co listed the
            following reasons for using a DSS:
        <br>
        <h4><i>Reasons</i> </h4>
        <hr>
    <br>
            •&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DSS is seen as an organizational winner;<br>
            •&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Need for precise or new information;<br>
            •&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Managers demanded DSS;<br>
            •&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reduce costs.<br>
        <br><br>
            One important reason mentioned for the development and use of a DSS is the
            facility provided to end users. The end users are neither programmers nor
            people trained in computers and they demand friendly tools and procedures for
            easy use.<br><br>
            A DSS should have the following features, according to Turban and Aronson
            (1998), and Mallach (2000):
        <br><br>
            1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;serve managers at different levels;<br>
            2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  allow decisions by an individual or group;<br>
            3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  be able to make both sequential and interdependent decisions;<br>
            4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  provide a variety of decision making styles;<br>
            5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  be user friendly;<br>
            6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; seek efficacy and not efficiency;<br>
            7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  facilitate the formulation of the problem by the end user; and<br>
            8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allow the analysis of results.<br>
        <br><br>
            DSS is intended to improve the efficiency of the decision-making process, to
            provide better administrative control and to facilitate communication. It allows
            for the analysis of existing alternatives, the optimizing alternatives and other
            combinations of decision alternatives. However, it is very difficult to have a
            DSS available at a low cost for nontraditional and nonstructured problems. The
            diversity and complexity of the decision-making process makes it hard to
            obtain an efficient and low cost DSS.
        <br><br><br>
       
        The sensitivity analysis made by in a DSS, by asking questions of “what – if?”
            type, has limited capacity in exploring for new facts, because the exploration
            is restricted to the area around an existing solution.
         <br><br>
            A DSS is a useful and efficient tool to foresee, generate, and evaluate the
            alternatives for solving administrative problems.
         <br><br><br>     
         <h3>   DSS Software Tools </h3>
         <div style="width: 100%;height: 5px;background-color: black;"></div>
        <br><br><br>
            DSS contains standard software packages to help make decisions developed
            for some specific problems. These packages are made available for public use
            because: a) many people make these decisions, so the potential market is large;
            and b) the decisions factors and objectives are the same for all of them, allowing
            the use of standard algorithms or chart representation. The following packages
            of software are usually available in a DSS:
         <br><br>
            1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Database management packages;<br>
            2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Query and information retrieval packages;<br>
            3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Statistical data analysis packages;<br>
            4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Forecasting packages; and<br>
            5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Graphing packages.<br>
         <br><br>
         <h4><i>Using the Forecasting Package</i></h4>
         <hr>
         <br><br>
            In the section titled Strategy and Decisions in Perspective, an illustrative case
            for the use of a Forecasting package is presented. In this section a brief
            description of the use of forecasting method is also presented. Different
            methods of forecasting and their uses are described in a DSS software tool.
            There is no universal forecasting method for all situations and circumstances.
         <br><br>
            A simple way to classify the problems that require forecasting is in terms of
            functional areas to which they relate. One of the reasons for this classification
            is that forecasting is merely a means for improving decision making and is not
            an end in itself. Since decision-making problems and processes are often
            grouped along a functional line (marketing, finance, or production), the
            integrative aspect of existing forecasting methods is important in the medium
            and short-term planning. Although each of the functional areas of business has
       
        <br>
        
      
           its own requirements for forecasts, a number of forecasts relates these
            functional areas and are important in the overall decision-making framework of
            the company.
        <br><br>
            It is possible to develop and use a single method of forecasting for a number of
            different situations. First, all these situations deals with the future and time is
            directly involved. Second, uncertainty is always present in forecasting situa-tions. The third situation is that a forecast uses information contained in
            historical data.
        <br><br>
Two types of forecasting methods can be considered:<i>qualitative and quan-titative methods.</i> Qualitative methods rely on managerial judgment without the
            use of specific models. Qualitative methods are useful when there is a lack of
            data or when past data are not reliable predictors of the future. Individual or
            group decision makers can utilize the best available data and a qualitative
            approach to arrive at a forecast. Examples of qualitative forecasting method
            are: Delphi technique and market surveys. In chapter 13, a case study working
            with qualitative methods (Delphi or NGT — Nominal Group Technique) in a
            GDSS (Group Decision Support System) environment will be presented.
        <br><br>
            There are two types of quantitative forecasting methods: time-series and causal
            forecasting. Quantitative methods has gained wide acceptance for at least three
            reasons: a) manager’s confidence on the record of past historical data; b) the
            adoption of computers (the forecasting package is one of the useful software
            tools in a DSS); and c) quantitative forecasts are much cheaper to obtain than
            any of the available alternatives.
        <br><br>
            Quantitative forecasting methods are used in a line of functions areas serving as
            an input for decisions on process design, capacity planning and inventory. Time
            Series forecasting methods, such as moving averages, exponential smoothing,
            or Box-Jenkins methods, are used for short to medium-range planning, but the
            integrative use in a line of functional areas makes quantitative forecasting
            methods useful also for long-germ strategic decision planning. For instance,
            information from a single forecast may be used simultaneously by marketing,
            production, finance, and accounting, and even by the personnel department
            helping in the decision of planning for the number of workers in each category
            to be hired and trained.
        <br><br>
            Time-series forecasting methods, considered as having a high level of accuracy
            and used mostly for short and medium-range planning, may assume strategic
            importance, for instance, when the marketing and operations departments
            discuss the upcoming budgeting cycle. Time-series forecasting methods offer
            a fast response in forecasting software available in most DSS systems.
